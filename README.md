A game with a setInterval to countdown the time you have to read and choose answers to the questions. The html is set to have different sections toggle on and off to display the start, the quiz area, and the total score at the end. Each question is generated on screen from Javascript. Lots of resources pulled from many different places.

Still need some work on the counting part. The answers are getting counted as wrong and the tally keeps adding on after a reset. Any offered help is, as always, appreciated.
